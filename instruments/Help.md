This folder contains example files. 
You need to upload them with your questionnaires in the MHIRA application
Each questionnaire needs either 'scales_table' or 'scales_script' to calculate the scales of the questionnaire.
Additionally, a 'cutoffs' file can be uploaded (this is recommended but optional). This will provide interpretation (figure legends and in text form) for the questionnaires.

The files provided are not needed in this folder for the shiny app to run. 
They need to be uploaded in MHIRA to take effect.
